This project was an exercise in duplicating a "404 page" from a Figma design file, using only HTML & CSS techniques.

- You can see the <a href="https://darrickfauvel.github.io/devchallenges-rwd-404-not-found/" target="_blank">project demo here</a>.
- Hand coded by me with no copied solution code.
- Developed using a mobile-first approach and applying a media query for the two-column desktop view.
- CSS Grid was used for the layout.
